## CS-300 DSA: Analysis and Design 22EW6

### What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
<p> In this couse we evaluated different data structues and algorithems used to implement those data structures. We then used the infomation gatherd to determine what data structure would be the best to use for the project requirments. The project was to read data from a CSV file and store the records from those files using one of the data structures. We would then be able to sort, search and display those records. </p>

### How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
<p> To determine the best data structure we evaluated the algorithms used for sorting, searching, loading etc. of each data structure and used BigO runtime analysis to determine the data structures with the best space and runtime complexities. </p>

### How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
<p> When I would encounter issues when working through this project or other activities during this course the main thing I would do to overcome them is research. I would use text books or the internet to research the issue I was having and how others had overcome the issue or other ways of doing what I was attempting to do. If I could not find a resolution that worked I would reach out for help. The coding community is full of people that are happy to help as long as you are putting the work in yourself.</p>

### How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
<p> I very much enjoyed learning about runtime analysis and using big O notation. Learning these skill really opened my eyes on what goes into making an efficient program. Its not about just using any data structure that will work for what you are attempting to do but finding the one that performs best.</p>

### How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
<p> During this project I attempted to demonstrate maintainable code by breaking the program up into seperate files and functions. I used a class that I called course to hold the records in a vector. This code would be adaptable to implement a number of different data sources without needing to completely overhaul the entier program. I attemped to follow standard programming practices while writing my code to maintain readability.</p>
